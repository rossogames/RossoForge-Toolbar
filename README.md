## RossoForge - Toolbar

**RossoForge - Toolbar** is a flexible system that allows you to create customizable toolbar buttons in the Unity Editor using ScriptableObjects.  
Each button is defined as a standalone asset, where you can configure its icon, tooltip, and behavior without modifying code.

With RossoForge Toolbar, you can:

- Quickly add custom buttons in your editor.
- Define custom actions for each button through easily extendable scripts.
- Save time and improve productivity with reusable button definitions.

This package is part of the **RossoForge** suite, designed to streamline and enhance Unity development workflows.
